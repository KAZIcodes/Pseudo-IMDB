# **Description**

---

This project is a simple terminal version of IMDB which is my first big project in **java** and it is done for the purpose of learning and practicing **data model designs**(with use of UML) and **object oriented programing in java**

### And more â€¦.

# Notes

---

Since the purpose of this project was for learning more advanced **OOP** and **data model design**, it lacks some error handling and the code can be cleaner and better; Some improvements that can be done are mentioned below:

- Some methods can be more generalized and the class in which they are placed can be changed to a more related one
- Some classes can be merged; for example **Member** and **Editor** can be a single class with an attribute to distinguish them
- In a real world program the data would be saved in a data base or there would be some methods to call some APIs for saving or getting data
